# Desert Crossing Solution Explanation

This is a brief explanation of my solution to the 'Desert Crossing' puzzle:

## Assumptions

I've made some assumptions here:

-There are at least four other drivable vehicles

-There are at least four drivers

-It's okay to abandon vehicles in the desert

-It's okay to abandon drivers in the desert, or it's okay to consolidate drivers into the remaining vehicles that still have fuel

## Process

The extra vehicles act as containers of extra fuel.  All four vehicles (including the military vehicle that carries the letter) drive a quarter of the way.  At this point, each vehicle's fuel-capacity has been halfed.  Fuel is transfered in a way that the military vehicle gets it's tank topped off along with one other vehicle.  At this point, the military vehicle and one other vehicle have full-tanks again, and two of the vehicles have empty tanks.  The two vehicles with full tanks drive on to the half-way point.

At the half-way point, each vehicle now has half a tank of fuel again.  The second vehicle transfers it's half-tank of fuel to the military vehicle.  At this point, the military vehicle has enough fuel to take it across the second-half of the desert.  (The second vehicle's fuel tank is now barren.  The second vehicle is left "in the dust".)  The military vehicle drives the remaining distance across the desert and delivers the letter.
