## Goat, Cabbage, Wolf

A farmer returns from the market, where he bought a she-goat, a cabbage and a wolf (what a crazy market :-). On the way home he must cross a river. His boat is small and won't fit more than one of his purchases. He cannot leave the she-goat alone with the cabbage (because the she-goat would eat it), nor he can leave the she-goat alone with the wolf (because the she-goat would be eaten).

How can the farmer get everything on the other side in this puzzle?
